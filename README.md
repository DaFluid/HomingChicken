# HomingChicken
A Minecraft mod that adds a homing rocket launcher fueled by chicken eggs

## Mod primary goals
- provide an item that launches a homming missile projectile
- ability to target mob entities (with GUI indicators)
- a firing animation where the projectile egg (with TNT and a fireworks rocket attached) is thrown, hatches mid-air and charges at the target
- screaming chicken sounds

## Secondary goals
- alternate firing modes (straight launch or bunker-buster)
- alternate rocket particle effects (depending on the type of firework used in the ammo recipe)
- combine 9 launchers for a anime-style mega launcher
  - more screams! more explosions! 9 times the ammo consumption!
  - only the middle missle hits the target dead-on, the rest shower the surrounding area for maximum AoE

## Additional possibilities (unlikely to see light of day)
- a separate mod addon that works with the Chickens, MoreChickens and Hatchery mods to do different effects based on egg used (requires Hatchery to be updated to 1.12)
- chicken enemies
  - every chicken spawn has a chance to spawn an aggressive chicken that attacks the player
    - urges surrounding chickens to be aggressive as well, Zelda style
	- kill the chicken and the other chickens turn passive again
  - chicken boss
    - summoned by building a totem with chicken heads that drop from aggressive chickens (simmilar to summoning the Wither) and by throwing enough eggs at the totem
	- chicken dinner reward!
- Chicken Invaders easter eggs
- backport to earlier Minecraft versions
